# FX8010-Emulator-VST
Emulate an E-mu DSP (Soundblaster Audigy Cards)

The goal is to emulate a powerful interpreter for DSP assembler instructions within a 
DSP environment based on the FX8010 architecture, which was found on Soundblaster Live!
and Audigy cards, as VST effect plugin. 
The core functionality is given, but not unit tested. Syntax checker, register &
instructions mapper and VST integration still need to be done.
